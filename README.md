File Tracking System ,as the name suggests,helps to track the files relevant to you( and your department if you are an HOD) which can get very difficult to track and search  manually. It can also be referred to as document management system and the idea can be implemented for any company as long as every employee is accessed to a database by a PC.
The basic idea is as follows:-
Someone wants to initiate a file ,he/she writes the necessary details on the system like in a virtual diary and the details are stored in the database. 
The file has then,gone through subsequent forwards from many employees depending upon the general office hierarchy(Chair > HOD > Employees) . The employees  along with other details like their departments through which the file has gone through are also stored in the database.
Now,suppose,after few days, that initiator employee wants to know where that file is , the computer automatically tells in a matter of milliseconds and s/he does not have to keep on asking his/her  colleagues.
Any employee can also see which are the files currently forwarded to him(or other employees of his/her department in case of an HOD) at that given moment.

The program has a lot of other features ,too,catering to the specific needs of any kind of employee ( Chair,HOD or other employees), which I think , might be useful.
